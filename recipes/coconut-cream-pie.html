        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>

            <li>3 cups half-and-half</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and bake it, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
