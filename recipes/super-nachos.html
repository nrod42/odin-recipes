            <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) package restaurant-style tortilla chips </li>
            <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can pitted black olives, drained and chopped</li>
            <li>4 green onions, diced</li>

        <strong>Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning mix and water and simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet; top with Cheddar cheese and dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully to prevent burning, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Top nachos with salsa, sour cream, black olives, green onions, and jalapeno peppers.</li>
        </ol>
